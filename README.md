# FlightCorridor
Flight Corridor for Online Maps Plugin for Unity

Upon request 

The input can be any polyline from a minimum of 2 to N (as many as I the user wants)

On 2 polylines draw parallel lines to display the corridor with the same distance in Nautical Miles or KM left and right foom the main line.
